The basic logic of this game is that player need to collect six pieces of keys to win. During this process, there are four types of enemies in different locations of the level. The player has 100 points of health and will be harmed when collides with enemies, or hits by enemies’ projectiles. When the health is deducted to zero or player is falling off the map, the game is over, and a restart button will show on the screen. The player can also attack enemies by shooting to them. The shooting direction is set by both the player character’s forward direction and the screen camera’s direction, in this way the bullet will be in a controllable direction by the player with left click on the mouse. The two types of movement of the player is walking and flying, which can be shifted by press the space on keyboard.

There are four types of enemies, the first type is pursuer, which is having a routine to patrol around the map and run fast at the player once player is in their sight. On collision with pursuer, the player will be impulse back for a distance and get health deducted. The second type is flyer, which will fly above the player while on sight and shoot to the lead direction of the player to make player’s moving forward dangerous. The third type is mortar, which is unmoving but shoot big bullet to the sky randomly and cause explosion. Once hit by the explosion, the player will have health deducted. If player is in the mortar’s sigh, the mortar will shoot towards player’s direction. The last type of enemy is the emitters, which will patrol randomly and shoot bullets in all directions while seeing the player. 
There is total six pieces of keys to be collected, and each of them is being underneath a colorful noticeable cloud. The player could find the key by tracing those clouds. In its way to collect all pieces of keys, the player can also collect some health packs to recover the health. When the player wins, the screen will show congratulation words and display a restart button. 

The details of health update are: -2 when player is hit by projectiles shot from flyer and emitter; -5 when player is collided with any types of enemies; -10 when player is hit by the explosion by mortar’s projectile; +10 when player collect a health pack.

The level is consisted of multiple islands, some of them are connected by ramps where player can walk on, and others are not connected, where player has to use fly function and keep itself from being hit by flyer enemy during flying. The keys are placed in different islands with colorful clouds to guide the player, so the player has to explore the whole level with different islands to collect all keys and to win the game. This design is aimed to help the player explore the level. The layout of the islands is also designed to give player a specific path to explore. For example, when the player gets the third key, there is not an obvious fourth cloud guiding the fourth key in their sight. However, there is an obvious way going up connected to the island and player can walk through it to find the next key. In this way the game is encouraging the player to explore the map by both proper guidance by colorful clouds and leading ways connected to the islands.
For the design of the enemy placing, each key is surrounded by several enemies with different type. The player is safe while floating in the sky, but the largest challenge for the player is that very key is on the ground and surrounded by lots of enemies, so the player must land near the key, shoot or hide from the enemies before getting the key, and keep itself from being kicked off the map by pursuer or hit by mortar’s projectile, which makes the game challenging. Pursuers and mortars are the most dangerous enemies that player should destroy or avoid, so the way to get each key is challenging but also fun. To make the game easier, several health packs are placed in the leading way of each key, which makes the player be able to recover the health after fight with enemies. There are more health packs in the beginning of the game than the later part of the game, this can give player more chance to get health in the beginning to get familiar with the logic and operation of the game without failing too quick.
